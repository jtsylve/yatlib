# YATLib v2
## Yet Another Template Library for C++

The goals of this project are to provide a centralized library to hold the various general-purpose types that I've used across my projects as well as to provide implementations of library features from C++20 and beyond as well as a select few proposals that have not yet made it into standards.

When standard implementations are available, those in the `yat` namespace will fall back to aliases of the standard types.
